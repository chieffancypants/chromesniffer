# ChromeSniffer
This is a fork of the original ChromeSniffer.  The maintainer hasn't merged a pull request in quite some time, so I'm pulling them here and adding my own along the way.

## Installation
First, you'll need to clone this repo:

```git clone git://github.com/chieffancypants/chromesniffer.git```

To install in chrome, go to the extensions panel (chrome://settings/extensions) and click the "Load unpacked extension' and provide it with the directory you just cloned.
